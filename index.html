        <p class="text-success">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the
          entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on
          the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the
          servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring
          celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there
          is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.

            <p>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a 2023 American animated superhero film featuring the Marvel
              Comics character Miles Morales / Spider-Man, produced by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation in
              association with Marvel Entertainment, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to
              Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), set in a shared multiverse of alternate universes called the
              Spider-Verse. The film is directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson and written
              by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, who both also produce, and David Callaham. Shameik Moore voices Miles,
              starring alongside Hailee Steinfeld, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Vélez, Jake Johnson, Jason Schwartzman,
              Issa Rae, Karan Soni, Shea Whigham, Greta Lee, Daniel Kaluuya, Mahershala Ali and Oscar Isaac. In the
              film, Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman across the Multiverse, where he meets a
              team of Spider-People led by Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 known as the Spider-Society but comes into
              conflict with them over handling a new threat in the form of the Spot.

              Sony began developing a sequel to Into the Spider-Verse prior to its 2018 release, with the writing and
              directing team attached. It was set to focus on the relationship between Moore's Miles and Steinfeld's
              Gwen. The sequel was officially announced in November 2019 and animation work began in June 2020, with a
              different visual style for each of the six universes visited by the characters.

            <p>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a 2018 American animated superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics
              character Miles Morales/Spider-Man, produced by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation in
              association with Marvel Entertainment, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It was the first
              animated film in the Spider-Man franchise.[4][5] Directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney
              Rothman (in Persichetti and Rothman's feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Phil Lord and
              Rothman, it stars Shameik Moore as Morales, alongside the voices of Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld,
              Mahershala Ali, Brian Tyree Henry, Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Vélez, John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn, Nicolas
              Cage, and Liev Schreiber. Inspired by the Amazing Spider-Man story arc "Spider-Verse", while also taking
              inspiration from the Ultimate Marvel comics "The Death of Spider-Man" and Spider-Men that served as Miles
              Morales' debut, the film's story follows Miles as he becomes the new Spider-Man and joins other
              Spider-People from various parallel universes to save his universe, as well as the multiverse, from
              Kingpin.

              Plans for an animated Spider-Man film by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were leaked in 2014 and
              announced in April 2015. Persichetti, Ramsey and Rothman joined over the next two years, with Moore and
              Schreiber cast in April 2017. Lord and Miller wanted the film to have a unique style, combining computer
              animation with traditional hand-drawn comic book techniques inspired by the work of Miles Morales
              co-creator Sara Pichelli. The film required up to 140 animators, the largest crew used by Sony Pictures
              Animation on a feature film.[6] The film is dedicated to the memories of the creators of Spider-Man, Stan
              Lee and Steve Ditko, who both died in 2018.

              Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse premiered at the Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles on December 1,
              2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 14. The film grossed $384.3 million
              worldwide against a $90 million budget and received critical acclaim. The film won Best Animated Feature
              at the 91st Academy Awards—being the first non-Disney/Pixar film to win the award since Rango (2011) and
              was similarly successful at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, the 72nd British Academy Film Awards, and the
              46th Annie Awards. Since its release, it has been regarded as one of the best animated films of the 21st
              century.
